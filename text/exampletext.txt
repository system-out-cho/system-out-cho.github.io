The old bookstore smelled like dust, glue, and a faint hint of coffee that had seeped into the floorboards sometime in the late ’90s and never left. Sunlight slid through the front window at an angle that made every floating speck look intentional, like the room was performing its own quiet magic trick. Someone had penciled notes in the margins of a history book—arguments, corrections, tiny jokes—and it felt less like vandalism and more like a conversation paused mid-sentence, waiting for the next reader to jump in.

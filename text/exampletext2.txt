Somewhere else entirely, a city bus hissed to a stop while a pigeon stared down the driver with unreasonable confidence. 
A kid tapped a cracked phone screen in rhythm with music only they could hear, while an ad above the seats promised a “new beginning” 
in aggressively cheerful font. The bus lurched forward again, carrying everyone along—people with plans, people with no plans, and 
people who swore this was the last time they’d take this route, even though it never was.

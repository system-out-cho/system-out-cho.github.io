                Making this personal portfolio with just raw html, css, and javascript was a really big learning experience that 
                taught me a lot about layouts with grids, flexboxes, and web optimizations. Having to create my own reusable components 
                through functions and data structures also taught me the necessity of libraries like React. This was really a project 
                just for fun since I did not want to have to continue paying for a website, but through it I found myself really enjoying 
                the process of thinking through challenges like how to make projects maintainable and easily editable. I really did not 
                want to have to copy and paste 100 lines of HTML each time I made a new project, so working through the advantages and 
                disadvantages of injecting html with javascript was also a really fun challenge. Check out the repo

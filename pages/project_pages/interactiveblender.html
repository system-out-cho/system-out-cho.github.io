                This was my final individual project for the PUP internship at Pixar. It involved taking my amazing mentor's 
                (Michael Frederickson) MIDI Fighter Twister and mapping its controls to a Blender Python script. Although simple 
                in concept, the way you could play with music and visuals simultaneously in REAL TIME was such an amazing experience.

                    I essentially took in inputs from the controller into Blender with the rtmidi API and mapped it to various aspects 
                    of Blender like camera controls, animation, shading, basically anything I could program or change with a knob or a 
                    press I did. Through this process, I was able to make a small “show” demonstrating its capabilities and ended up 
                    performing it in front of lots of Pixar employees! The show involved creating one or two shots and slowly bringing 
                    each component of the shot in with layers to a song. I split Kendrick Lamar's “All The Stars” into different components 
                    like the bass, vocals, etc. When the bass kicked in, certain elements would appear on the scene. It was so fun, that 
                    I ended up buying my own MIDI Fighter Twister much later…

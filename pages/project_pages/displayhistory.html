                    During my internship with MAKE, we worked a lot with ComfyUI and experimenting with new ways
                    to interact with upcoming technologies. After developing our workflow, I noticed that it was 
                    very inconvenient to have to track my past parameters for any given node. This led to the development
                    of this node calld DisplayHistory, which holds past parameter data for every node in the workflow. 
                    Parameters are stored when a workflow is successfully run. The skeleton of the node is made in Python,
                    but a majority of the its processes and data handling occurs in javascript. Every time a workflow is successfully run, 
                    each node's data is passed onto a function that stores all the parameters, and Display History shows the stored data.
                    The core functionality was implemented pretty quickly, but debugging issues like having new nodes in a workflow,
                    deleting nodes, changing node names, and data storage were all difficult challenges during development.
